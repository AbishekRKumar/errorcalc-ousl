üìñ Overview
ErrorCalc-OUSL is a web-based tool designed to simplify error analysis for experimental sciences. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an intuitive interface for students to calculate errors directly in their browsers. Tailored for Level 3, 4, and 5 students at The Open University of Sri Lanka, it supports laboratory work by providing accurate calculations for absolute, relative, percentage errors, and error propagation.
‚ú® Features

Error Calculations: Computes absolute, relative, and percentage errors for measurements.
Error Propagation: Handles addition/subtraction and multiplication/division error propagation.
Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly form inputs with real-time results.
Responsive Design: Accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Educational Outputs: Displays results with explanations to enhance learning.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
No server setup required; runs locally as a static HTML file.

Installation

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/AbishekRKumar/errorcalc-ousl.git


Navigate to the Directory:cd errorcalc-ousl


Open the Application:Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., double-click the file or drag it into your browser).

Dependencies

No external dependencies; uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Optional: A local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code) for development.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Open index.html in a web browser.
Select a calculation type from the dropdown:
Absolute, Relative, and Percentage Errors
Error Propagation (Addition/Subtraction)
Error Propagation (Multiplication/Division)


Enter the required values (e.g., measured value, true value, uncertainties) in the form.
Click "Calculate" to view results displayed below with clear explanations.

Example Output
For Measured Value: 10.5, True Value: 10.0
Absolute Error: 0.5
Relative Error: 0.05
Percentage Error: 5%
